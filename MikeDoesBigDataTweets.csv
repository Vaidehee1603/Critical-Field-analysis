11/12/2015,23:51,MikeDoesBigData,@ctesta_oneill No questions on #U-SQL yet? :) Enjoy the weekend!
12/12/2015,08:17,ctesta_oneill,@MikeDoesBigData I will get back to you. A production release has got in the way at the moment.
11/12/2015,20:08,MikeDoesBigData,We just released a video on @ch9 showing how the new #Azure #DataLake Tools give you local run and debug for #U-SQL. https://t.co/jz05XdpL4c
11/12/2015,20:00,MikeDoesBigData,@bwishan It is mentioned but not clearly enough. Will have to make it pop more.
11/12/2015,20:00,bwishan,"@MikeDoesBigData Reading those in more detail, I guess it is doc'd, but was just hard for me to find. Thanks again!"
11/12/2015,19:56,MikeDoesBigData,@bwishan pattern is at https://t.co/bIcv6T6BgE ; https://t.co/mbbiz0Ay6z shows the syntax in EXTRACT; sample at https://t.co/ug3OCPangc
11/12/2015,19:59,bwishan,@MikeDoesBigData Thanks! Found those last night and figured it out. The virtual column is what got me confused since it's not doc'd yet.
11/12/2015,19:51,MikeDoesBigData,@SqlWaldorf here is the link where we discuss it: https://t.co/7oLtJ2Yaav
11/12/2015,19:49,MikeDoesBigData,@SqlWaldorf This is a known issue that the team is working on fixing. The work around is to set your local locale to en-us for now.

06/11/2015,23:19,jamie_dixon,@MikeDoesBigData you never showed up for the F# ML workshop!  We missed you.

06/11/2015,01:49,OliverAsmus,@jamie_dixon @MikeDoesBigData That would make sense too
06/11/2015,01:21,MikeDoesBigData,@jamie_dixon @OliverAsmus I can neither confirm nor deny that it stands for 'being next after T' or for U- as in U-Boot (sub to dive in ADL)
06/11/2015,00:51,isaac_abraham,@MikeDoesBigData @OliverAsmus in fact having worked with both for years i'd go as far as to say i'm not sure when C# is a better fit period
06/11/2015,00:13,MikeDoesBigData,"@isaac_abraham @OliverAsmus You can write the assembly code in F#. And well, there are many more C# than F# programmers (unfortunately ;) )"
06/11/2015,00:14,isaac_abraham,"@MikeDoesBigData @OliverAsmus yep, re: assembly - that's what I meant in my original tweet the other day."
06/11/2015,00:15,isaac_abraham,"@MikeDoesBigData @OliverAsmus  Re: more C# than F# - spot on, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a missed opportunity."

06/11/2015,00:09,isaac_abraham,"@MikeDoesBigData @OliverAsmus it is nice. but it's a really big missed opportunity not having F# integration, IMHO. A much better fit."

02/09/2011,06:35,MikeDoesBigData,@DrHouseOfSQL sounds great. Trimix sounds like overkill though. Did some wrecks in Cavailaire at 40m with 30% Nitrox. Did you take pictures?
04/09/2011,11:20,DrHouseOfSQL,"@SQLServerMike No pictures on that dive, just memories. :)"
04/09/2011,11:23,DrHouseOfSQL,@SQLServerMike I agree on the overkill part but my buddy was a divemaster and he was also supporting someone who went solo for 15' @ 50m.
04/09/2011,13:53,DrHouseOfSQL,"@SQLServerMike correct me if I am wrong, but isn't 40m exceeding the MOD for EAN30 assuming 1.4 ppO2? Or do you use 1.6 as reference?"

01/09/2011,21:21,MikeDoesBigData,@DrHouseOfSQL Nice. Where did you dive? How long and what airmix?
02/09/2011,06:07,DrHouseOfSQL,@SQLServerMike that was an air dive so really short bottom time. My partner was on trimix 25/25. Total runtime was about 30 min.
